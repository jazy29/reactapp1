# LearnReact1
This is my first dive into learning to react. I watched "Programming With Mosh: React Tutorial for Beginners" It is a really comprehensive guide that helped me learn a lot of concepts in react, this includes 
how to create a project using Vite, Usestates, naming conventions, and hooks.
